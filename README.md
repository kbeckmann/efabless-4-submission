# Efabless AI Wake Up Call Submission

Challenge: https://efabless.com/genai/challenges/4

## Proposal

In order to solve the problem of implementing Keyword Spotting (KWS) on very limited hardware, this project aims to solve this by implementing compact and optimized DSP blocks and scheduling around this.

Optimized low bit matrix multiplication with systolic arrays could be an option.
